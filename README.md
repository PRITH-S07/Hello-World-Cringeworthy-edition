# Hello-World-Cringeworthy-edition

This is probably one of the most useless things ever to be posted on GitHub. Nevertheless, here you are so let's give you some intro into this piece of useless code.<br>
I have trained an NLP model on the lyrics from Adele's song 'Hello' and then performed text prediction, searched for the words 'hello' and 'world' in the text and printed the obvious.
If you have any other beautifully stupid versions of Hello World!, please fork this repository and work on it asap!
